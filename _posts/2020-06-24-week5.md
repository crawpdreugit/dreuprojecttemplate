Applied trigonometry to get robot to move relative to the direction it was facing with each keystroke (w,s,a,d). I then read on right-hand rule and used that coordinate system for the backend. We continued our daily scrum and project meetings and also held our second course development meeting where we had a course development expert talk to us about the structure for the first year robotics courses we are working on.
