I had our scrum and project meetings and continued work on simulating an Infrared distance sensor and on added blogs to my DREU website in fulfillment of the fourth and last milestone. I started getting ready to finish my internship and set up my deliverables for the summer. 
For the IR sensor simulator at the backend, I have to use the bressemham's line algorithm to determine the path from a start node to a finish node or obstacle and calculate the distance.
