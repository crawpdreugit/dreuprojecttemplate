Introduction to the members of the graduate program at the AABL.Talked to Mentor about potential research ideas and paths I couldgo. The first path is that I could do a mini research project, like aposter. The benefits of that is being able to declare I did the entireresearch myself which would be good if i wanted to pursue furtherinto AI, Robotics and Machine Learning. The second option is thatI can work with a graduate student on a project and get secondauthor. The pro is being able to be in a publication which wouldbe good for graduate school. The task I needed to do is to learnMachine Learning, clean up python and set up meetings to talk thegraduate students about their research. I also changed the link andworked on the DREU website.
