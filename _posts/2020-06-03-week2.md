Had daily scrums and 2nd  project meeting.
Worked on A* algorithm implementation and got it working on the 5th.


Had talks on creating simulations on the 9th and 10th. Started work on the canvas and watched some videos on the 9th but my task was switched to the back end which is getting input from the keyboard or joystick to the web socket weâ€™ll create and Sophie would handle the front end which is taking the velocity controls and making the robot movement visible on the simulator visualization (the canvas section)

Wrote a code on accepting and printing out input in python on the 10th to prep for my actual task and also got my diary setup on google docs.
