Talked with another team member and the project manager to get the front-end to convert the backend coordinate system (right-hand rule) to front-end coordinate system (pixels) to visualize robot and map. Finished robot angular movements and sending it and map over to front-end on two websockets. We had our every week meetings and held our third course development meeting and continued talks on how to structure the courses after which I helped a teammate draft a syllabus for one of the courses.
