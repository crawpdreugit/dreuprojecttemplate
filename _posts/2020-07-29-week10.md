Had my last project meetings with my teammates. We also had a goodbye brunch for us interns and we spent hours hanging out on zoom, having brunch, chatting, and playing games. I wrapped up my project, did a presentation at my mentor's lab's general meeting. I also attended my last course development meeting and we discussed what the next steps were going to be. I also spent a lot of time going through my DREU requirements for my last milestone and had discussions with my mentor on whether I could still be on the team. I officially ended my internship on Wednesday, the 5th of August, although I still went to meetings and worked on stuff for the next two days.
