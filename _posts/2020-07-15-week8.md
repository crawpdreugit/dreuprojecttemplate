I attended the meetings for the project and our fourth course development meeting. We had discussions about the hardware focused course we are developing. I finished LCM-websocket connection for the backend codes and tested it on an html file - worked but still didn’t in the main front end html file. I also started work on simulating an IR distance sensor for a probable ROB 102 class project: read and watched videos on Bressenham’s Line algorithm.
