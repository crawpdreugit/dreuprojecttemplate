Had daily scrums and project meeting.
Started work on the simulator backend code on the 11th of taking input and converting to velocity commands. 
Installed websocket and read on it on the 14th after I got the velocity commands code working.

Met with another team member (Sophie) to discuss websockets on before scrum on the 15th.
