## June 1 2021 ##

Introduction to the members of the graduate program at the AABL. I talked to Dr. Short about potential research ideas. I was advised to talk to other graduate students to get more of an idea what I want to focus on for my research. I was advised to learn Machine Learning, Python, some of the Python Libraries and ROS before I get started.

### Here are some of the libraries from Python I will most likely use doing my research:
* [Numpy] (https://numpy.org/learn/)
* [SciPy] (https://www.scipy.org/)
* [SciKit] (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [PyTorch] (https://pytorch.org/)
