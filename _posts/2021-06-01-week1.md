## June 1 2021 ##

Introduction to the members of the graduate program at the AABL. I talked to Dr. Short about potential research ideas. I was advised to talk to other graduate students to get more of an idea what I want to focus on for my research. I was advised to learn Machine Learning, Python, some of the Python Libraries and [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials) before I get started.

### Some of the Python Libraries used for research in AI and ML:
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/learn/)
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [SciKit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)

I started learning [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home). I meet up with a graduate student to learn more about their project and learned the three type of learning robots can do.

1.Inverse Reinforcement Learning:
  * The researcher guides the robot to do a certain task.
  * A researcher might physically guide the robot arm to com-plete a certain task.
 
2.Preference Learning:
  * A robot has to complete a task. However, it is given options to complete the task.
  * This gives the robot more freedom to be able to make a choice.
 
3.Reinforcement Learning:
  * A robot is rewarded for doing a task correctly.
  * The robot is told it done a task correct or wrong.
  * The most popular type of learning for Machine Learning.

This particular graduate student uses reinforcement learning to speed up the time a robot is able to learn a task trhough human help/feedback.
