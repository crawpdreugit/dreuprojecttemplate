Talked with Jana(project manager) and started work on getting slam map to front-end through a second websocket. Had to read map information from a file and store the 200 by 200 grid cell map into a 2D array as well as extract the map data and parse them into individual data for the front-end. I attended the scrum and project meetings. Also, we had our first course development meeting on the 18th and we discussed about general set up and content of ROB 102, one of the courses we are developing.
